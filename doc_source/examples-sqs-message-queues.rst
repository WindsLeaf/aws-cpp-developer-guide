   :description: How to create, list, delete, and get an Amazon SQS queue's URL with the AWS SDK for
                 C++.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for C++ code examples

A *message queue* is the logical container you use to send messages reliably in |sqs|. There are two
types of queues: *standard* and *first-in, first-out* (FIFO). To learn more about queues and the
differences between these types, see the |sqs-dg|_.

These C++ examples show you how to use the |sdk-cpp| to create, list, delete, and get the URL of an |SQS|
queue.

.. include:: includes/examples-note.txt

.. _sqs-create-queue:

Create a Queue
==============

Use the |sqsclient| class :functionname:`CreateQueue` member function, and provide it with a
:aws-cpp-class:`CreateQueueRequest <aws_1_1_s_q_s_1_1_model_1_1_create_queue_request>` object that
describes the queue parameters.

**Includes**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/sqs/create_queue.cpp
   :lines: 14-18

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/sqs/create_queue.cpp
   :lines: 36-50
   :dedent: 8

See the :sdk-examples-cpp:`complete example <sqs/create_queue.cpp>`.


.. _sqs-list-queues:

List Queues
===========

To list |SQS| queues for your account, call the |sqsclient| class :functionname:`ListQueues` member
function, and pass it a :aws-cpp-class:`ListQueuesRequest
<class_aws_1_1_s_q_s_1_1_model_1_1_list_queues_request>` object.

**Includes**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/sqs/list_queues.cpp
   :lines: 14-18

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/sqs/list_queues.cpp
   :lines: 28-46
   :dedent: 8

See the :sdk-examples-cpp:`complete example <sqs/list_queues.cpp>`.


.. _sqs-get-queue-url:

Get the Queue's URL
===================

To get the URL for an existing |SQS| queue, call the |sqsclient| class :functionname:`GetQueueUrl`
member function.

**Includes**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/sqs/get_queue_url.cpp
   :lines: 14-18

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/sqs/get_queue_url.cpp
   :lines: 35-47
   :dedent: 8

See the :sdk-examples-cpp:`complete example <sqs/get_queue_url.cpp>`.


.. _sqs-delete-queue:

Delete a Queue
==============

Provide the :ref:`URL <sqs-get-queue-url>` to the |sqsclient| class :functionname:`DeleteQueue` member
function.

**Includes**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/sqs/delete_queue.cpp
   :lines: 14-18

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/sqs/delete_queue.cpp
   :lines: 37-56
   :dedent: 8
