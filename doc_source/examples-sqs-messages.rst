Sending, Receiving, and Deleting |SQS| Messages

   :description: How to send, receive, and delete Amazon SQS messages with the AWS SDK for C++.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for C++ code examples

Messages are always delivered using an :doc:`SQS queue <examples-sqs-message-queues>`. These C++
examples show you how to use the |sdk-cpp| to send, receive, and delete |SQS| messages from SQS
queues.

.. include:: includes/examples-note.txt

.. _sqs-message-send:

Send a Message
==============

You can add a single message to an |SQS| queue by calling the |sqsclient| class
:functionname:`SendMessage` member function. You provide :functionname:`SendMessage` with a
:aws-cpp-class:`SendMessageRequest <aws_1_1_s_q_s_1_1_model_1_1_send_message_request>` object
containing the queue's :ref:`URL <sqs-get-queue-url>`, the message body, and an optional delay value
(in seconds).

   :lines: 14-17

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/sqs/send_message.cpp
   :lines: 36-49
   :dedent: 8

See the :sdk-examples-cpp:`complete example <sqs/send_message.cpp>`.


.. _sqs-messages-receive:

Receive Messages
================

Retrieve any messages that are currently in the queue by calling the |sqsclient| class
:functionname:`ReceiveMessage` member function, passing it the queue's URL. Messages are returned as a
list of :aws-cpp-class:`Message <aws_1_1_s_q_s_1_1_model_1_1_message>` objects.

   :dedent: 4

See the :sdk-examples-cpp:`complete example <sqs/receive_message.cpp>`.


.. _sqs-messages-delete:

Delete Messages after Receipt
-----------------------------

After receiving a message and processing its contents, delete the message from the queue by sending
the message's receipt handle and the queue URL to the |sqsclient| class :functionname:`DeleteMessage`
member function.
