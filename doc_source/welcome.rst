AWS SDK for C++ Developer Guide
###############################

Welcome to the |sdk-cpp-dg|.

The |sdk-cpp| provides a modern C++ (version C++ 11 or later) interface for |AWSlong| (AWS). It
provides both high-level and low-level APIs for nearly all AWS features, minimizing dependencies and
providing platform portability on Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile.
