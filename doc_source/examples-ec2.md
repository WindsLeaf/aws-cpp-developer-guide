Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) is a web service that provides resizable computing capacity—literally servers in Amazon’s data centers—that you use to build and host your software systems\. You can use the following examples to program [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2) using the AWS SDK for C\+\+\.

**Note**  
Only the code that is necessary to demonstrate each technique is supplied here, but [complete example code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/cpp), where you can download a single source file or you can clone the repository locally to get all examples, build and run them\.
