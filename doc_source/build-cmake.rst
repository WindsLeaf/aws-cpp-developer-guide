Building Your Application with CMake

        Using CMake to build an application that uses the AWS SDK for C++.
    :keywords:

CMake_ is a build tool that can manage your application's dependencies and create native makefiles
suitable for the platform you're building on. It's an easy way to create and build projects using
the |sdk-cpp|.

Setting Up a CMake Project
==========================

.. topic:: To set up a CMake project for use with the |sdk-cpp|

   #. Create a directory to hold your source files.
      ::

        mkdir my_example_project

   #. Open the directory and add a :file:`CMakeLists.txt` file that specifies your project's name,
      executables, source files, and linked libraries. The following is a minimal example.

      .. literalinclude:: example_code/general/CMakeLists-minimal.txt
          :language: cmake

.. note:: You can set many options in your :file:`CMakeLists.txt` build configuration file. For an
   introduction to the file's features, see the `CMake tutorial
   <https://cmake.org/cmake-tutorial/>`_ on the CMake website.


Setting CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH (Optional)
====================================

CMake needs to know the location of the :file:`aws-sdk-cpp-config.cmake` so that it can properly
resolve the AWS SDK libraries that your application uses. You can find this file in the build
directory that you used to :doc:`build the SDK <setup>`.

By setting the path in :envvar:`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`, you won't need to type this path every time you
rebuild your application.

You can set it on |unixes| like this.
::

   export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/sdk_build_dir

On Windows, use :code:`set` instead.
::

   set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:\path\to\sdk_build_dir


Building with CMake
===================

Create a directory into which :command:`cmake` will build your application.
::

   mkdir my_project_build

Open the directory and run :command:`cmake` using the path to your project's source directory.
::

   cd my_project_build
   cmake ../my_example_project

If you didn't set :envvar:`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`, you must add the path to the SDK's build directory
using :code:`-Daws-sdk-cpp_DIR`.
::

   cmake -Daws-sdk-cpp_DIR=/path/to/sdk_build_dir ../my_example_project

After :command:`cmake` generates your build directory, you can use :command:`make` (or
:command:`nmake` on Windows) to build your application.
::

   make
