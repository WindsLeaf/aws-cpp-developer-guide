Using the |sdk-cpp|

    :description:
        Initialize and set options to use the AWS SDK for C++.
    :keywords:

To use the |sdk-cpp|, you should properly initialize it with :code:`Aws::InitAPI` before creating
service clients and using them. You should then shut down the SDK with
:code:`Aws::ShutdownAPI`.

Both of these functions take an instance of :aws-cpp-struct:`Aws::SDKOptions
<aws_1_1_s_d_k_options>`, which you can use to set additional run-time options for SDK calls.

.. _sdk-initializing:

Initializing and Shutting Down the SDK
======================================

A basic skeleton application looks like this:

.. code-block:: cpp

   #include <aws/core/Aws.h>
   int main(int argc, char** argv)
   {
      Aws::SDKOptions options;
      Aws::InitAPI(options);
      {
         // make your SDK calls here.
      }
      Aws::ShutdownAPI(options);
      return 0;
   }

.. admonition:: best practice

   To properly shut down / clean up any service clients that you may initialize before
   :code:`Aws::ShutdownAPI` is called, it's a *best practice* to make sure that all SDK calls
   are made within a pair of curly-braces as shown above, or within another function called between
   :code:`Aws::InitAPI` and :code:`Aws::ShutdownAPI`.

.. _sdk-setting-options:

Setting SDK options
===================

The :aws-cpp-struct:`Aws::SDKOptions <aws_1_1_s_d_k_options>` struct shown in
:ref:`sdk-initializing` provides a number of options you can set. You should send the same options
object to both :code:`Aws::InitAPI` and :code:`Aws::ShutdownAPI`.

A few examples:

* Turn logging on using the default logger:

  .. code-block:: cpp

     Aws::SDKOptions options;
     options.loggingOptions.logLevel = Aws::Utils::Logging::LogLevel::Info;
     Aws::InitAPI(options);
     {
         // make your SDK calls here.
     }
     Aws::ShutdownAPI(options);

* Install a custom memory manager:

  .. code-block:: cpp

     MyMemoryManager memoryManager;
     Aws::SDKOptions options;
     options.memoryManagementOptions.memoryManager = &memoryManager;
     Aws::InitAPI(options);
     {
         // make your SDK calls here.
     }
     Aws::ShutdownAPI(options);

* Override the default HTTP client factory:

  .. code-block:: cpp

     Aws::SDKOptions options;
     options.httpOptions.httpClientFactory_create_fn = [](){
             return Aws::MakeShared<MyCustomHttpClientFactory>(
                 "ALLOC_TAG", arg1);
         };
     Aws::InitAPI(options);
     {
         // make your SDK calls here.
     }
     Aws::ShutdownAPI(options);

.. note:: ``httpOptions`` takes a closure instead of a ``std::shared_ptr``. The SDK does this for
   all of its factory functions because the memory manager will not yet be installed at the time you
   will need to allocate this memory. Pass a closure to the SDK, and it will be called when it is
   safe to do so. This simplest way to do this is with a Lambda expression.
