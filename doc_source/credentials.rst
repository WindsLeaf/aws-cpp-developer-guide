        Different ways to supply AWS credentials when using the AWS SDK for C++.
    :keywords:

To connect to any of the supported services with the |sdk-cpp|, you must provide AWS credentials.
The AWS SDKs and CLIs use :emphasis:`provider chains` to look for AWS credentials in several
different places, including system/user environment variables and local AWS configuration files.

You can set your credentials for use by the |sdk-cpp| in various ways, but here are the
recommended approaches:

.. the following file is in the shared content...

.. include:: common/sdk-shared-credentials.txt

After you set your AWS credentials using one of these methods, the |sdk-cpp| loads them automatically
by using the default credential provider chain.

You can also supply AWS credentials using your own methods by:

* Providing credentials to an AWS client class constructor.

* Using |COG|_, an AWS identity management solution. You can use the
  ``CognitoCachingCredentialsProviders`` classes in the identity-management project. For more
  information, see the |COG-dg|_.
